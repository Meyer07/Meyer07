## Hi there 👋

My name is Sam Meyer

I am a college student at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Studying Computer Science and pursuing a certification in Cyber Security
My coding journy has been pretty tough for me as I have really only been coding for two years now and have really gotten proficient in it
in the past year or so, however with each process learned and project completed I'm finding a deeper love and connection with coding

my last few projects have been ones to help me get into the job market either in Software Engineering or in Cyber Security 
each have been teaching me things about tools and scripts that I can use in each in a real world scenario away from the books and lectures of classrooms

in my personal time I enjoy playing trading card games, video games watching some of my favorite TV shows(Suits,Yu-Gi-Oh!,My Hero Academia) and hanging out with friends
